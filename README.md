The project I've made here is a guessing game for a random number that the
computer secretly chooses. The players chooses the range he wants to play at,
going between 1-x. This basically means the difficulty of the game, the higher
range you choose the harder the game will become.        
After choosing the range you will be able to guess the secret number, and the
terminal will print out whether the number is correct or not. If it is wrong 
you will be given tips on whether the number you guessed is too low or too high
compared to the secret number chosen by the computer.         
After guessing the correct number you will be given statistics on how many tries
it took you to guess the secret number.          

***FEATURES***           
The game is very simple to understand as it is text based. The first input you have to do is where you choose the upper range for the game, and you do so by typing in the number you want as the upper range.        
After this you will be able to type in your guess of the secret number.        

***TESTING***        
There was a lot of testing being done during my work with the project. I do the testing during my work with the code, and not only after I've finished to solve potential bugs as they appear, instead of fix a whole lot of bugs at once after the code is already written.      
My main way of testing is to run the program after I've written some new code, to make sure that I don't break anything and that the written code works as intended.       
I also read the problem warnings in the terminal which might give me a good hint if I've made a mistake somewhere in my code.

***CREDITS***        
There's no way for coders to remember all the code of a language in their head, and for this reason it might be a good idea to have some people to speak with to make your work a whole lot easier. I have done this with my project, and I will credit the sources I've used during the development of this project:
